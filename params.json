{"name":"Bashing","tagline":"A Bashing plugin for svo (svo.vadisystems.com)","body":"A bashing script Achaea\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nWhat's this?\r\n------------\r\n\r\nWhile bashing (or hunting NPCs) in Achaea is not overly complicated, it is sometimes useful to handle targets in a certain\r\norder instead of going through the seemingly random list from top to bottom. Different types of targets in an area make\r\nbasing even more cumbersome. To avoid having to target specific NPCs by number (which is error prone and slow), this project\r\nwas born.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Mudlet\r\n- gmcp enabled\r\n- **svo**\r\n\r\nDownloads and Releases\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nThe bashing script can be downloaded on the [github release page of the project](https://github.com/keneanung/Bashing/releases).\r\n\r\nStable releases are versioned with the versioning scheme `vXX.XX` where each XX stands for a number. The latest official\r\nstable release has a green tag on the left side.\r\n\r\nReleases with an orange tag are pre-releases for testing. *Those are automatically generated and not guaranteed to work.*\r\nAdditional to a numeric version number, the versioning scheme contains a short commit hash and a branch name. If you notice a\r\nproblem with a pre-release, please include this information in your bug report.\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\n1. Download the Bashing.mpackage\r\n2. Import the package into Mudlet\r\n3. Deactivate or delete the keybinding of F2 that comes with svo.\r\n4. Use the alias `kconfig bashing toggle` to enable the script\r\n5. Start killing things. Acceptable targets must be killed at least once in an area to register them with the bashing script.\r\n6. Keep bashing away using the F2 keybinding to work yourself down the list.\r\n\r\nPriority management\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nNew acceptable targets are always added to the end of a priority list of an area. To change this, you will need to change the\r\norder manually.\r\n\r\nUse `kconfig bashing prios` to bring up the list of areas with priority lists. You can then click on an area name to bring\r\nthe priority list for that area. To filter the list of areas, you can use `kconfig bashing prios <partial area name>`. If\r\nonly one match is found, the list for that area is shown instead.\r\n\r\nBy using `kconfig bashing prios <area name>` or clicking on an area name in the area list, the script will bring up the\r\npriority list for the area. If you are in that area and have one of these denizen in your room, the script will order them\r\nfrom top to bottom. That means the topmost NPC type has the highest priority and the one at the lower end of the list the\r\nlowest priority.\r\n\r\nTo change the position of an item in the list, click the `(vv)` and `(^^)` arrons to lower or raise the priority\r\nrespectively. You can also click on the `(DD)` to delete that NPC as an acceptable target.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
