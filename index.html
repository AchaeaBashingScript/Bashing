<h2>
<a id="whats-this" class="anchor" href="#whats-this" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's this?</h2>

<p>While bashing (or hunting NPCs) in Achaea is not overly complicated, it is sometimes useful to handle targets in a certain
order instead of going through the seemingly random list from top to bottom. Different types of targets in an area make
basing even more cumbersome. To avoid having to target specific NPCs by number (which is error prone and slow), this project
was born.</p>

<h2>
<a id="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mudlet</li>
<li>gmcp enabled</li>
<li><strong>svo</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="downloads-and-releases" class="anchor" href="#downloads-and-releases" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Downloads and Releases</h2>

<p>The bashing script can be downloaded on the <a href="https://github.com/keneanung/Bashing/releases">github release page of the project</a>.</p>

<p>Stable releases are versioned with the versioning scheme <code>vXX.XX</code> where each XX stands for a number. The latest official
stable release has a green tag on the left side.</p>

<p>Releases with an orange tag are pre-releases for testing. <em>Those are automatically generated and not guaranteed to work.</em>
Additional to a numeric version number, the versioning scheme contains a short commit hash and a branch name. If you notice a
problem with a pre-release, please include this information in your bug report.</p>

<h2>
<a id="quickstart" class="anchor" href="#quickstart" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quickstart</h2>

<ol>
<li>Download the Bashing.mpackage</li>
<li>Import the package into Mudlet</li>
<li>Deactivate or delete the keybinding of F2 that comes with svo.</li>
<li>Use the alias <code>kconfig bashing toggle</code> to enable the script</li>
<li>Start killing things. Acceptable targets must be killed at least once in an area to register them with the bashing script.</li>
<li>Keep bashing away using the F2 keybinding to work yourself down the list.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="priority-management" class="anchor" href="#priority-management" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Priority management</h2>

<p>New acceptable targets are always added to the end of a priority list of an area. To change this, you will need to change the
order manually.</p>

<p>Use <code>kconfig bashing prios</code> to bring up the list of areas with priority lists. You can then click on an area name to bring
the priority list for that area. To filter the list of areas, you can use <code>kconfig bashing prios &lt;partial area name&gt;</code>. If
only one match is found, the list for that area is shown instead.</p>

<p>By using <code>kconfig bashing prios &lt;area name&gt;</code> or clicking on an area name in the area list, the script will bring up the
priority list for the area. If you are in that area and have one of these denizen in your room, the script will order them
from top to bottom. That means the topmost NPC type has the highest priority and the one at the lower end of the list the
lowest priority.</p>

<p>To change the position of an item in the list, click the <code>(vv)</code> and <code>(^^)</code> arrons to lower or raise the priority
respectively. You can also click on the <code>(DD)</code> to delete that NPC as an acceptable target.</p>
